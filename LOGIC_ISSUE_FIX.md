# Logic Issue Fix: skin_scores Empty Data Problem

## Problem Identified

The main issue was in the **PHP logic condition** used to check if form fields have values:

```php
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix)
if (!empty($data[$field_name])) {
    // Insert skin score data
}
```

## The Issue Explained

PHP's `empty()` function returns `true` for:
- `null`
- `false` 
- `0` (integer zero)
- `"0"` (string zero)
- `""` (empty string)
- `[]` (empty array)

**This means that if a user entered "0" as a skin score value, the `!empty()` check would evaluate to `false`, and the data would NOT be inserted into the database.**

This is particularly problematic for skin assessment scores where:
- "0" might be a valid score (e.g., severe skin condition)
- Users often input scores in the 0-10 range
- "0" represents meaningful data, not missing data

## The Fix Applied

```php
// FIXED CODE (after fix)
if (isset($data[$field_name]) && $data[$field_name] !== '') {
    // Insert skin score data
}
```

**This new condition:**
- Uses `isset()` to check if the field exists in the submitted data
- Uses `!== ''` to only exclude empty strings, not zero values
- Allows "0" values to be properly inserted into the database

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Form fields with value "0" were ignored
- Only non-zero values were saved to database
- API returned incomplete skin_scores data
- Frontend displayed empty assessment sections

**After Fix:**
- All valid numeric values (including "0") are saved
- Complete skin assessment data is stored
- API returns full skin_scores data set
- Frontend displays all assessment values correctly

## Files Modified

1. **models/eeform/Eeform1Model.php** - Fixed both `create_submission()` and `update_submission()` methods
2. **Added comprehensive debugging** to track field processing
3. **Created test file** to verify data collection logic

## Verification

Use the test file `test_form_data.html` to verify that:
- Fields with "0" values are correctly identified for insertion
- Empty fields are properly excluded
- The logic works as expected before and after the fix

## Additional Debugging

Enhanced debugging now shows:
- Each field being processed with its actual value
- Whether fields meet the insertion criteria
- Success/failure status of each database insertion
- Complete data flow from form to database

This fix resolves the core issue where valid "0" scores were being treated as empty data and excluded from database storage.
